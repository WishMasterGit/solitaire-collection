# Yukon

1 Deck.  Medium (35%).  Mostly Skill.

## Description

A well-known game with no stock or waste, in which stacks of cards can be moved even if they aren't in sequence.

## Cards

One standard deck.

## Goal

Move all cards to the foundation.

## Foundation

Four foundation piles.

Any ace may be moved to any empty pile in the foundation.

A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is one higher than the old top card of the pile and of the same suit.Thus, the only card that could be played on a 9♠ would be a 10♠.

Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off..

## Tableau

Seven tableau piles of cards, arranged as below, where "D" indicates a face-down card and "U" indicates a face-up card:

  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
 --------------------
  U  D  D  D  D  D  D
     U  D  D  D  D  D
     U  U  D  D  D  D
     U  U  U  D  D  D
     U  U  U  U  D  D
     U  U  U  U  U  D
        U  U  U  U  U
           U  U  U  U
              U  U  U
                 U  U
                    U

A card may be added onto a tableau pile if it is one lower than the old top card of the pile and of the opposite color.Thus, the cards that could be played on J♥ would be 10♠ or 10♣.

Cards on the tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation or any other tableau pile.

Empty spaces in the tableau may be filled by kings only.

Furthermore, any face-up card anywhere in the tableau may be moved to another tableau column where it fits, taking all cards that were on top of it along.

Common Variations:

Some people allow cards to be moved back off the foundation.

Similar Games:

Alaska (Play) (Rules)
    A somewhat more difficult variation of Yukon in which you can build up or down, but must build in the same suit. I think they call it "Alaska" because it is so cool when things work out.

Russian (Play) (Rules)
    A harder variation of Yukon where you must build down in the same suit instead of in alternate colors.

Double Yukon (Play) (Rules)
    A two-deck variation of Yukon

Triple Yukon (Play) (Rules)
    A three-deck variation of Yukon

Yukon Cells (Play) (Rules)
    A variation of Yukon simplified by the addition of two cells.

Yukonic Plague (Play) (Rules)
    A more difficult variation of Yukon where many cards are buried in a reserve.

Yakutat Bay (Play) (Rules)
    A cross between Yukon and Moving Left.
