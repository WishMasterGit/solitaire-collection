1 Deck.  Hard (8%).  Mostly Skill.

## Object

To discard all the cards.

## Layout

• ``stock`` (top left, face down) -  Turn over 1 card at a time to the tableau by clicking.  No redeals.

• ``waste`` (bottom right) - where cards are automatically moved out of play.

• ``tableau`` - where cards are dealt from the stock.  Cards are dealt in a row.  Any card may be moved onto the card immediately previous to it or onto the card 3 cards previous to it if the cards are of the same suit or rank.  For example, if the cards in the row are the 3 ♣, 5 ♥, 9 ♦ , 9 ♣, the 9 ♣ can be moved on either the 9 ♦ (because they are the same rank and the 9 ♦ is one card previous) or the  9 ♣ can be moved on the 3 ♣ (because they are the same suit and the 3 ♣ is 3 cards previous).  When cards reach the end of the screen the cards will go down to the next row in serpentine fashion.
