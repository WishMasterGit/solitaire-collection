# Queenie

## Description

Build stacks of cards in alternating colors as in Klondike, move arbitrary groups of cards as in Yukon, and deal waves of cards onto to the tableau, as in Spider.

## Cards

One standard deck.

## Goal

Move all cards to the foundation.

## Foundation

Four foundation piles.

Any ace may be moved to any empty pile in the foundation.

A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is one higher than the old top card of the pile and of the same suit.Thus, the only card that could be played on a 7♣ would be an 8♣.

Once on the foundation, cards may not be moved back off...

## Tableau

Seven tableau piles with one card in the first pile, two cards in the second, three in the third, and so on. All cards are dealt face up.

A card may be added onto a tableau pile if it is one lower than the old top card of the pile and of the opposite color.Thus, the cards that could be played on Q♠ would be J♥ or J♦.

Cards on the tableau that are not under another card are available for play onto the foundation or any other tableau pile.

Empty spaces in the tableau may be filled by kings only.

Furthermore, any face-up card anywhere in the tableau may be moved to another tableau column where it fits, taking all cards that were on top of it along.

## Stock

The remaining cards form the stock.

Each time you click on the stock, a card will be dealt on top of each tableau pile.
